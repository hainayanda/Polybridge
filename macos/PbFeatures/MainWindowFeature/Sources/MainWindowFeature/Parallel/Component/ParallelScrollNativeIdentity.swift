/// observer's observation view — the bounded path a List-backed feed needs: its own NSScrollView
/// is not reachable as the representable's `enclosingScrollView` (the observation view must sit
/// outside the marker pair, and inside a virtualized row it would die with the row), so the
/// identity comes from PbUI's strict marker-pair discovery instead.
///
/// The holder never defers on its own: the scope relay's single generation-guarded main-queue
/// delivery is the only asynchrony, so an unmounted or replaced observation view is exactly a
/// weak miss — no stale attach callback can reach a dead view. Registration re-delivers the last
/// known identity so a queued restoration survives the observation view's own initial mount, and
/// an explicit nil detaches the observation view's native notifications and wheel monitor — fail
/// closed, never a fallback to any enclosing scroll view.
