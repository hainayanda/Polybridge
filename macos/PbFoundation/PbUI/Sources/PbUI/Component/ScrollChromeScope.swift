//
//  ScrollChromeScope.swift
//  PbUI
//
//  Bounded component-local scroll chrome targeting (adjudicated plan step 2) for the controls and
//  containers whose own NSScrollView cannot be reached by the document probe: TextEditor,
//  multiline TextField, List and Form. The scope brackets its content with two hidden,
//  noninteractive markers whose endpoints share ONE direct superview after at most one sole-child
//  wrapper is normalized per marker; discovery accepts exactly one
//  candidate NSScrollView between the markers' sibling indices in that superview's public
//  subviews — the scroll view itself, or wrapped in at most one wrapper view — and requires the
//  converted frames of the markers, normalized endpoints and candidate to match. The candidate
//  matches by its full converted frame first; only when that fails does one final fallback
//  apply: exact equality against the candidate's bounds inset by its public contentInsets,
//  converted through the candidate's own public coordinate conversion with top/bottom applied
//  per its isFlipped — the shape a container takes when its own native footer safe-area inset
//  excludes part of the content area. Ambiguity (zero or multiple
//  candidates, a missing or differently hosted peer, mismatched frames, no laid-out bounds) fails
//  closed: no attach, as do insets that are negative, nonfinite, leave nonpositive inset bounds
//  or still mismatch; all-zero insets reproduce the full frame and add no fallback, and no inset
//  height is ever guessed as a constant. No window scan, no arbitrary parent descent, no private class-name guesses,
//  no timers, no KVO, no render publications — reconciliation happens on mount, update, reparent
//  and the markers' own frame-changed notifications, guarded by weak identity checks, and only
//  that. A native chrome restyle that SwiftUI's own update/layout pass applies after the
//  synchronous reconciliation is answered by the shared owner's one public style observation,
//  never by a rescan, retry or deferred pass here.
//
//  Applying the scope to a List or Form brackets the container itself, so ownership is
//  independent of row presence: an empty, populated-then-emptied or virtualized list keeps its
//  chrome with no fabricated placeholder rows and no row probes as the sole owner. A native text
//  control with no dedicated NSScrollView is an evidence-backed no-op, not a missing
//  implementation. The shared field editor is never a target: a candidate whose document view is
//  a field-editor NSTextView is rejected, and its scroll/clip ancestors cannot pass the same
//  check either. A no-op scope adds no invisible gesture layer and no focusable or accessibility
//  element.
//
//  Optional native identity disclosure: `scrollChromeScope(onNativeScrollView:)` additionally
//  hands the SAME bounded discovery result to a caller-supplied handler — the scoped container's
//  own NSScrollView, or nil. The two markers report independently into one relay that aggregates
//  them: an identity survives while either live marker still reports it, nil is delivered only
//  once every live marker reports nothing (a churning marker never unseats its peer's scope), an
//  identical NSScrollView is never redelivered, and delivery is deferred to the main queue with a
//  generation guard so no identity is published during layout and only the newest knowledge ever
//  publishes. Every reference — markers, scroll views, the delivered identity — is weak, so a
//  deallocated candidate is absent at the next report delivery, fail closed; weak zeroing alone
//  does not schedule delivery. The handler changes no chrome behaviour; the
//  markers keep their chrome tokens exactly as before, and a scope installed without a handler
//  leaves the relay unused.
