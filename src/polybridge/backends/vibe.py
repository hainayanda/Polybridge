"""Mistral vibe backend.

CLI facts established by measurement (vibe 2.25.1), not assumption — see also the plan that
introduced this module and CLAUDE.md's per-CLI section.

**Invocation and stdin**
* `get_prompt_from_stdin()` runs unconditionally before mode dispatch and reads `sys.stdin` whenever
  it is not a tty, blocking forever on a pipe that never closes. Small prompts use DEVNULL;
  prompts over 32 KiB use one-shot UTF-8 stdin followed immediately by EOF and trailing `--prompt=`
  to select programmatic mode. Native stdin ingestion strips outer whitespace: large prompts with
  outer whitespace fail explicitly rather than being altered. Start and resume use this transport.
* Programmatic mode is `-p/--prompt TEXT` with `--output streaming`. **The `PROMPT` positional is
  ignored in programmatic mode** — the CLI reads `args.prompt or stdin_prompt` — so there is no
  working `--` separator of the kind codex and opencode rely on. `-p` is `nargs="?", const=""`, so a
  prompt starting with `-` is not taken as its value and the run falls through to stdin (DEVNULL),
  dying with "No prompt provided". Hence the single canonical token `--prompt=<text>`, positioned
  last: measured — a prompt beginning `--max-turns` reached the model verbatim at exit 0, unparsed as
  a flag.
* Exit codes are clean: 0 on success; 1 for a limit breach, a teleport error, or any
  RuntimeError/ValueError, message on stderr, never in the JSON stream.
* Untrusted workspaces warn and continue in programmatic mode rather than prompting, but `--trust` is
  passed anyway so project configuration is honoured rather than silently ignored.

**The stream**
* `--output streaming` emits only `PublicHistoryEntry` objects with `generation_status == COMPLETED`.
  Observed `type`s: `message` (role `user`|`assistant`, a `content` parts list), `reasoning` (`text`),
  `checkpoint`, `effect` (a tool call), `callback` (an approval request). Unknown types are ignored,
  not fatal.
* **An auto-denied approval leaves no other trace, measured.** A `git commit` run against a repo
  whose `[tools.bash]` allowlist did not cover it emitted a `callback`
  (`detail.kind: "approval"`, carrying the tool name and the exact command), then an `effect` with
  `state.status: "cancelled"`, and then **ended with no assistant message at all, at exit 0**. The
  `callback` is therefore the only thing that can explain how the turn ended, and `ingest` records
  it on `acc.denials` (surfaced as `permission_denials`); without that the caller is never told a
  command was refused. Since 2026-09-26 such a turn no longer reads as a failure by itself: the
  withdrawal of the turn's close (a pre-refusal narration is not an answer) is accompanied by
  `stream_state["ended_on_refusal"]` and one outcome-neutral warning on `acc.notices`, and a run
  that ends this way at an *observed* zero exit reports **`completed` with that warning** rather
  than `failed` with an empty summary — the refusal says the agent was stopped, not that the run
  failed, and a real dispatch whose every edit had landed was reported `failed` only because its
  last action was refused. A later assistant message in the turn clears the flag and removes only
  that warning; a new turn resets both with the other turn-scoped fields; the denial itself stays
  on `acc.denials` either way. Every genuine failure signal still wins in `classify` — an error,
  a non-zero or unobserved exit, a turn-cap breach (checked explicitly, so a denial cannot
  complete a turn that also breached its cap). The accepted trade-off, stated so it is not
  rediscovered as a bug: this reintroduces the 2026-09-22 false success — a run that narrates, is
  refused, changes nothing and exits 0 reads `completed`; the warning is the signal, and for an
  editing task the worktree is the check.
* No terminal event, no dollar cost, no token counts — `reports_cost_usd=False`, and
  `total_cost_usd`/`usage` stay `None`. `num_turns` also stays `None`: counting `turn_start` records
  would not correspond to what `--max-turns` actually caps, and a wrong number is worse than none.
* `sessionId` is on every entry including the first.
* **History replay on resume, measured.** A `--resume` run emits, in order: the prior user message,
  the prior `reasoning`, the prior assistant message, a `checkpoint`, and only then the live turn.
  Replayed entries carry `turnId: null` and `source: "harness"`; the live turn's user message carries
  `source: "turn_start"` with a real `turnId`, and later assistant entries in that turn share it. A
  fresh run has no replay and its first user message already has a real `turnId`. `ingest` is
  marker-first (waits for a `turn_start` before accepting anything) rather than treating `turnId is
  None` as the discriminator, so it still holds if a future vibe stamps ids on replayed entries too.
* Hitting `--max-turns`/`--max-price`/`--max-tokens` raises `ProgrammaticLimitError` → exit 1: a
  breach reads as **failed**, not a clean stop, unlike claude. **Gate 1, measured**
  (`--max-turns 1` on a prompt needing a tool call): exit 1, stderr
  `<vibe_stop_event>Turn limit of 1 reached</vibe_stop_event>` — and the stream's live-turn
  `assistant` message carries that same marker text. A naive ingest would set `saw_final_message`
  from it and report the marker as the agent's answer; `ingest` instead recognises the marker only
  when the *entire* message is the stop-event envelope (a legitimate answer that merely quotes or
  discusses the token, as this module's own docstring does, must still be preserved), and records it
  as a notice.

  Recognising it is not enough on its own. An earlier step in the same turn may already have
  recorded ordinary assistant text, so merely *declining* to add the marker leaves
  `saw_final_message` still asserting a clean close, and the marker itself would be reported as the
  agent's answer. So the evidence is **withdrawn** (`summary` cleared, `saw_final_message` reset)
  and **latched** in `stream_state`, so nothing later in the turn can re-establish it; the latch is
  turn-scoped like the rest of that state.

  This was originally load-bearing for a second reason that no longer applies: `store.py` used to
  substitute exit code `0` for a run it never saw exit, so a recovered breach would have been
  published as `completed`. `classify` now takes `int | None` and this backend requires an
  *observed* zero exit, so that path is closed at the source. The withdrawal stays because it is
  independently correct — the marker is not an answer and must not be reported as the summary — not
  because it is compensating for that bug.

  `is_error` is deliberately *not* set from this. A real breach already exits 1, so the flag adds
  nothing there, while setting it would make a false positive at exit 0 unrecoverable.

  The accepted trade-off: an assistant message whose *entire* content is exactly a stop-event
  envelope is treated as a breach even at exit 0, so a legitimate answer consisting of nothing but
  that envelope would be discarded. That is judged vanishingly unlikely against the recovery hole it
  closes — stated here rather than left implied.

**Freedom levers** (`vibe/core/agents/models.py`)
* `--agent plan` sets `write_file`/`edit` to `permission: "never"` (allowlisted only inside the plans
  dir) — a real refusal. **But `bash` is untouched**, falling back to the user's own `[tools.bash]`
  config; a user with `permission = "always"` there could still write via `bash`. So
  `writes_confined` is **False** at every freedom.
* `--agent accept-edits` auto-approves `write_file`/`edit` only. `--agent auto-approve` sets
  `bypass_tool_permissions: True`. Every approval callback is otherwise auto-denied in programmatic
  mode, so anything not pre-approved by the agent profile or the user's own config simply fails.
* **No OS sandbox**: `os_sandbox=False`, hence `os_enforced=False` at every freedom. Whether `git
  commit` is even reachable depends on the user's `[tools.bash]` allowlist, not anything polybridge
  sets — so `per_command_deny=False`, `commit_push_blocked=False`,
  `direct_commit_commands_denied=False`.

**Why model and reasoning effort are unsupported**
vibe has no `--model` flag and no effort flag at all — both are config-only
(`[[models]].thinking`, vocabulary `off/low/medium/high/max`). Resolving either safely would require
reading vibe's config-layer precedence (lowest to highest: schema defaults, GrowthBook experiments,
user TOML, **project TOML** (outranks the user's own, and `--trust` honours it), `VIBE_*` env vars,
runtime overrides, **agent-profile overrides** (always in effect here, since `--agent` is always
passed), enforced admin config) — several of which outrank an env override and are not inspectable
from here. A silent no-op — the override landing on the wrong model, or being overridden by a layer
polybridge cannot see — is exactly the failure mode this repo exists to prevent, so both are refused
outright (`supports_model_selection=False`,
`reasoning_effort=ReasoningEffort(accepts_parameter=False, ...)`) rather than attempted unsafely. A
faithful effort translation, if this is ever revisited, is `low->low, medium->medium, high->high,
xhigh->max` — vibe's own OpenAI-responses backend maps its `max` to `xhigh`.
