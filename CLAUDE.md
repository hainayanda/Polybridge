# polybridge

MCP server (stdio) that dispatches coding tasks to headless agents — Claude Code, Codex, opencode,
vibe and Antigravity (`agy`) — without blocking the caller. README.md is the short user-facing
overview; the tool surface is the docstrings in `server.py`, and this file is what you need to change
it safely.

Sibling project: `~/Code/claude-code-bridge` is the single-agent version. Its hardened core
(registry, persistence, drainers, cancellation, progress-aware waiting, config editing) was ported
here; fixes worth having in both should be applied to both.

```

**`uv tool install --force` alone reinstalls stale code.** The version never changes, so uv reuses its
cached wheel: it prints `Installed 1 package` and leaves the old `.py` files in place, mtimes and all
(measured — a fix was "installed" three times before anyone checked). Always pass `--no-cache`, and
verify by grepping the installed copy under
`~/.local/share/uv/tools/<tool>/lib/python*/site-packages/`, not by trusting the output.

## Architecture: everything agent-specific lives behind `Backend`

`backends/base.py` defines the contract; `backends/claude.py`, `backends/codex.py`,
`backends/opencode.py`, `backends/vibe.py` and `backends/antigravity.py` implement it. **Nothing outside `backends/` may branch
on a backend's name.** If you find yourself writing `if backend == "codex"`, the seam is missing a
method.

Each backend supplies: argv builders (returning an `Invocation` — argv plus stdin wiring and any
initial stdin bytes), `assert_safe` (over the whole `Invocation`), `enforcement`, `ingest` (normalise
its stream into `Accumulator`), `normalize`, `classify` (decide the terminal status from its own
signals), `encode_live_message` (one message in its CLI's live-input format, or
`UnsupportedCapability`), and `interactive_resume_argv` (the command a human runs to resume the
session in the CLI's own UI — built at takeover time, never stored, None when unsafe). Adding a
backend should mean one new module plus a registry entry — nothing else. That held when `opencode`
was added: the only non-`backends/` changes were docs, the places that enumerated the two names, and
tests. It held again for `vibe`: no change to the `Backend` protocol was needed, even though vibe
rejects both `model` and `reasoning_effort` outright — that only needed a `supports_model_selection`
capability field beside the existing `reasoning_effort` one, not a protocol change. `antigravity`
was the fifth, and the first since claude with live input. It needed one more capability field,
`live_input_message_is_turn`, because agy runs every written message as its own turn where claude
folds a mid-turn message into the turn already running. The pump in `tasks.py` reads that field,
never the name. If your next backend needs more than a module, a registry entry and a declared
capability, the seam is missing a method.

`Capabilities` exists so callers are told, not surprised. Unsupported requests **fail loudly**:
`max_turns` on Codex raises rather than being dropped, checked both in `server.py` and again in the
backend itself.

## Installing is a second seam: `clients/`

`backends/` is *who we dispatch to*. `clients/` is *who can launch us* — the Claude desktop app,
Claude Code, Codex, opencode, vibe. Same rule: nothing outside `clients/` branches on a client's name,
and adding one should mean one module plus a registry entry.

The two kinds share only the interface. The desktop app has no CLI, so `desktop.py` edits its JSON
(merge, back up, atomic replace). The other four own config formats we have no business
reformatting — 78 KB of application state, hand-commented TOML, JSONC, and TOML again — so they are
driven through their own `mcp add`, which stores the entry in each one's own shape.

`Result.status` is seven values, not two, for the same reason `Enforcement` is strict: `unknown` exists
because a CLI that times out may already have written the config, so `failed` there would be a guess
stated as a fact. `removed` and `not_installed` are the two uninstall outcomes that did not go wrong,
kept apart because only one of them changed anything. And success is reported as "add command
succeeded", never "registered" — exiting zero is all that was observed.

Every client implements `inspect(key, run)` and `remove(key, run)` as well as `apply`. Both take the
server's key, not a `Registration`, because neither may need the server binary — an uninstall has to
work after it is gone. `Inspection.installed is None` means "could not tell", never "not installed".

## Verified CLI facts

Measured on this machine. Do not "tidy" these away:

**Claude Code (2.1.260)**
- `-p --output-format stream-json` refuses to start without `--verbose`.
- `--disallowedTools` is variadic — patterns must be one comma-separated value.
- `--max-turns` works but is undocumented in `--help`.
- Never symlink-resolve the `claude` path: `~/.local/bin/claude` points into a versioned directory,
  so resolving it pins `PATH` to today's version and breaks at the next update.
- `--effort <level>` accepts `low, medium, high, xhigh, max`. **An invalid value is silently
  degraded**: stderr gets `Warning: Unknown --effort value '<v>' — ignoring it and using the default
  effort`, and the run proceeds anyway — the CLI never refuses to start. This is why polybridge
  validates `reasoning_effort` itself rather than passing an unrecognised value through: a dropped
  request would otherwise look like a run that honoured it.
- **Dropping the deny patterns does NOT let a run commit — the lever is `--allowedTools`.** This was
  the plan's assumed mechanism and it is wrong. Measured, three paired runs in a scratch repo with a
  local bare remote:
  - with `--disallowedTools "Bash(git commit:*),Bash(git push:*)"`: both refused,
    `Permission to use Bash with command ... has been denied.`
  - with those patterns simply **omitted**: still refused, but a *different* message —
    `This command requires approval`. `acceptEdits` auto-approves *edits*, not arbitrary Bash, and
    headless `-p` has nobody to approve, so the command dies either way.
  - with `--permission-mode acceptEdits --allowedTools "Bash(git commit:*),Bash(git push:*)"`: both
    **succeeded**, `permission_denials` empty, and the commit landed in the bare remote.
  So the `publish` freedom drops the git denies *and* adds the allow entries; passing both would be
  self-defeating, since deny beats allow. `--allowedTools` is variadic exactly like
  `--disallowedTools`, so its patterns are likewise one comma-separated value.
- **`-p` is a boolean flag and the prompt is a separate positional**, so a prompt token equal to a
  real option name is parsed by claude as that option. The prompt therefore rides after a `--`
  separator, as on codex and opencode. Measured both ways: without `--`, a prompt of
  `--dangerously-skip-permissions` reached claude's own parser and aborted for lack of a prompt;
  with it, the same text was delivered literally. Also measured on **resume** —
  `--resume <id> -- "<option-shaped prompt>"` preserved the session id and delivered the text
  verbatim, so the separator holds on both paths. That is the **classic** shape, which claude now
  uses only when `max_turns` is set (see live input below).
- **Live input: `--input-format stream-json`, a stdin pipe, and the prompt as the first stdin
  line** — `{"type":"user","message":{"role":"user","content":[{"type":"text","text":…}]}}`.
  Measured on 2.1.281 (`tests/test_live_input_real.py`): next to `--input-format stream-json` **a
  positional prompt is silently ignored** (exit 0, no model call), so the live shape has no `--` and
  no positional at all. A message written mid-turn is folded into that turn (one `result`); after a
  `result` the process idles until more input or EOF; EOF after a result exits 0 in ~1.2 s; a
  message written just before EOF still runs as its own turn; `--resume` takes the same shape.
  `total_cost_usd` is cumulative per process, `num_turns`/`usage`/`permission_denials` per result.
  `--max-turns` with live input is unmeasured, so a capped run stays classic.
  **`assert_safe` accepts exactly these two shapes and validates each completely**: classic is `--`
  plus one positional, no `--input-format`, stdin DEVNULL, no initial input; live is no `--`, every
  token a known option (so no positional), `--input-format stream-json` exactly once, no
  `--max-turns`, a pipe, and an `initial_input` that is exactly one well-formed user line. It takes
  the whole `Invocation`, so a live argv wired to DEVNULL (or a classic one to a pipe) is refused, and
  a bare argv list is refused outright.
- **`--include-partial-messages` streams text as it arrives (measured 2.1.283, real captures in
  `tests/fixtures/claude_partial_*.jsonl`) — in the classic `-p` shape, in the live shape, and on
  `--resume`.** The stream gains `stream_event` lines: `message_start` (carries the message id),
  `content_block_start` (carries the block's `index`), `content_block_delta` (`text_delta` carries
  a text chunk; `thinking_delta`, `signature_delta` and `input_json_delta` carry nothing
  polybridge surfaces), `content_block_stop`, `message_delta`, `message_stop`. Claude still emits
  one `assistant` event **per content block** — after that block's deltas, before its
  `content_block_stop` — so a streamed chunk's identity is `(message_id, block_index)`, and the
  `result` line is unchanged. Subagent `stream_event`s carry a non-empty `parent_tool_use_id` like
  other subagent events. polybridge normalizes the deltas to an additive `assistant_delta` event
  kind, with optional `message_id`/`block_index` on `assistant_text` — a new *kind* is additive
  under `EVENT_LOG_VERSION` 1 (older apps decode it as `.unknown`), so the version does not bump.
- **Background tasks (measured, 2.1.281).** `system/task_started` carries `is_backgrounded` — and a
  *foreground* Bash emits `task_started` too, with `is_backgrounded: false`, plus its own
  `task_notification`, so only `is_backgrounded: true` counts. On finish: `system/task_updated`
  with `patch.status: "completed"`, then `system/task_notification` `status: "completed"`; with
  stdin still open claude then **starts a follow-up turn by itself** and emits another `result`.
  EOF while one runs kills it: `patch.status: "killed"`, notification `status: "stopped"`, no
  further result, exit 0 — nobody ever sees that task's output. EOF at the moment of the
  notification still lets the follow-up turn finish.
- **The approval layer refuses a chained command citing each part separately** — a run that bundled
  `git commit -am wip` with `echo "EXIT: $?"` was refused naming both — so an allow-listed command
  is still refused when it arrives chained to something else.
- `bypassPermissions` with the denies dropped permits commit and push (measured the same way:
  empty denials, commit in the remote). Note this makes `unrestricted` a **behaviour change** —
  before the `publish` work the denies were passed at every level, and deny beats bypass, so
  `unrestricted` did *not* permit an ordinary `git commit` despite its name.

**Codex (codex-cli 0.153.2)**
- **`codex exec` blocks forever reading stdin.** `stdin=DEVNULL` is mandatory, not tidiness. The
  stdin wiring now comes from each run's own `Invocation` (`stdin_mode`), never from a backend name:
  only a live-input claude run gets a pipe, and every other backend's `assert_safe` refuses anything
  but a DEVNULL Invocation with no initial input.
- An approval prompt would hang a headless run equally, hence pinned `-c approval_policy="never"`.
- Prompt goes after `--`, so prompt text can never be parsed as an option.
- The stream is nothing like Claude's: session id is **`thread_id`** on `thread.started`; the final
  answer is an `item.completed` with `item.type == "agent_message"`; there is **no terminal
  success/failure event** and **no dollar cost**, only token counts on `turn.completed`.
- An `item.type == "error"` was observed in a *successful* run — error **items** are notices. A
  **top-level** `{"type": "error"}` event is a real failure. Do not conflate them.
- `workspace-write` permits `[workdir, /tmp, $TMPDIR]` — it is **not** repo-only.
- `-c model_reasoning_effort="<level>"` is not validated by the CLI at all; an unsupported value
  reaches the API as a mid-run `400`/`turn.failed` rather than being rejected up front. Confirmed
  honoured end to end: a run at `"ultra"` (outside polybridge's four-level vocabulary) recorded
  `"reasoning_effort":"ultra"` in its own session rollout.
- `codex -C <dir>` into an untrusted directory was recorded here as failing outright on 0.153.2.
  **Re-measured on the same version and it does not, at least for `codex exec`:** a fresh
  `/tmp` directory, `git init`-ed and never trusted (absent from `~/.codex/config.toml`), ran
  normally under `-s read-only`, and a second fresh directory ran under `-s workspace-write` too.
  So a sandboxed test on a fresh `-C` target is not expected to fail for trust reasons. The
  original note may have been about the interactive CLI rather than `exec`, which was not
  re-tested — so this narrows the claim rather than deleting it.
- **`workspace-write` defers network to the user's own config; `sandbox_workspace_write.network_access`
  is the switch.** Measured with one `curl https://example.com` per sandbox, on a config that does
  not set the key: `read-only` → blocked (`curl: (6) Could not resolve host`); `workspace-write` →
  blocked, same error; `workspace-write` plus `-c sandbox_workspace_write.network_access=true` →
  **HTTP 200**; `danger-full-access` → HTTP 200.
  **That "blocked at workspace-write" is a property of the config, not the sandbox** — measured
  again with `[sandbox_workspace_write] network_access = true` in the user's own `config.toml`, a
  plain `workspace-write` run reached the network (HTTP 200). So polybridge passes an explicit
  `...=false` wherever it reports `blocked` (measured: that returns it to exit 6), and names the
  override in the `Enforcement.mechanism` string. `read-only` was measured immune to the key even
  with it set true, so it takes no override. The first version of this note generalised from one
  clean machine — the same mistake as the vibe `mcp add` measurement below. That is what makes `publish` a genuine tier on codex rather than a relabelling: without
  it a push cannot reach a remote at all.
  The key name came from the binary's own strings — it carries both `[sandbox_workspace_write]` and
  the sentence *"In `workspace-write`, network access still depends on your Codex configuration (for
  example `[sandbox_workspace_write] network_access = true`)"* — which mattered, because **codex does
  not validate `-c` keys at all** (see `model_reasoning_effort` above): a guessed key would have been
  silently ignored, and "network still blocked" would have been indistinguishable from "wrong key".
  The switch opens **general** network access, not git or `gh` specifically — anything inside the
  sandbox can reach the network — so the enforcement block says that rather than implying it only
  unlocks pushing.
- **`codex exec resume` rejects `-C`/`-s`: they are global `codex exec` options, absent from `codex
  exec resume --help`.** Measured on codex-cli **0.154.0**, 2026-09-16 (the rest of this Codex
  section was measured on 0.153.2 and was not re-measured here). Using a bogus thread id so a parse
  success shows up as `no rollout found for thread id …` rather than an option error:
  `codex exec --json -C <dir> -s read-only -c approval_policy="never" resume -- <id> <prompt>`
  parses; `codex exec resume --json -C <dir> …` (the shape polybridge shipped) does not — `error:
  unexpected argument '-C' found`, exit 2, before any model call. So `build_resume_argv` places the
  option region *before* `resume`, with `resume` as the region's own last token, immediately before
  `--`. The shipped shape was never observed to work: it failed this way in the field (a reported
  resume, exit 2 in 0.119s), it fails on 0.154.0 here, and the same rejection was recorded for `-s`
  on 0.145.0 — three points, not a proof about every version in between.
- **`item.started`/`item.completed` `file_change` items are now normalized, not dropped.** The raw
  item is `{"type":"file_change","changes":[{"path","kind"}],"status":"in_progress"|"completed"}` —
  previously `_normalize_item_started`/`_normalize_item_completed` handled only
  `command_execution`/`mcp_tool_call`, so an edit codex made through this item type never reached
  the Monitor's event stream at all (measured against real `~/.polybridge/tasks` logs while adding
  the Monitor's Summary tab, 2026-09-26). Each change now gets its own `tool_call`
  (category `edit`, tool `file_change`, `call_id` = `"<item id>:<path>"` — path, not list index, so
  pairing survives the changes list being reordered between start and completion) and, on
  completion, a `tool_result` with `ok = (item's own status == "completed")` — codex reports no
  per-change status, only one for the whole item. A completion-only item (no prior `item.started`)
  synthesizes its `tool_call`s first, exactly like the shell/MCP completion paths already did.

**opencode (1.18.18)**
- `run --format json` emits clean JSONL — `step_start`, `tool_use`, `text`, `step_finish`, `error` —
  with `sessionID` on every event, so the id is known from the first line.
- **`cost` on `step_finish` is per step, not cumulative.** A three-step run reported 0.0583 / 0.0149
  / 0.0148; the run cost 0.0881. Assigning instead of accumulating understates it fourfold. Token
  counts are per step for the same reason.
- `step_finish.reason` is `tool-calls` mid-run and `stop` on the last step. That is the *only*
  end-of-run signal — a `text` part can appear at any step, so "saw some text" cannot tell a finished
  run from one killed mid-flight.
- A top-level `error` event comes with exit code 1. There is no terminal success event.
- `--` is honoured; `-s <id>` resumes into the same session id (both verified).
- Its parser also accepts `--flag=value` and compact `-sID`, and **a later value wins**: appending
  `--format=default` after `--format json` disabled the JSON stream outright (measured). So
  `assert_safe` walks the option region and refuses any non-canonical token instead of searching for
  flags — a search sees one `--format` and passes while opencode honours the other one.
- No grandchild process: the server runs in-process, so the CLI leader is the only pid.
- **`--agent build` writes and runs commands without `--auto`** (measured: it created a file and ran
  `git status` unprompted). So `--auto` is not what separates writing from not writing. That is all
  that run establishes — it does *not* show what `build` permits in general, nor that `--auto` never
  matters, since per its help it auto-approves whatever would otherwise be *asked*. `--agent plan`
  *declined* to write — model restraint, not a layer refusing it. All enforcement booleans are False.
- `--variant <level>` **is honoured, but silently ignored with no warning at all** on a value it
  doesn't recognise — worse than claude's stderr notice. Verified on
  `opencode/muse-spark-1.3-contributor-free`, one prompt, three paired runs per level: reasoning
  tokens rose monotonically with the variant — 75/95/99 at `minimal`, 172/201/230 at `low`,
  239/254/308 at `xhigh`. Non-overlapping, but note the low-to-xhigh margin is narrow (230 vs 239);
  the wide, unambiguous separation is `minimal` against `xhigh`, and `minimal` is deliberately
  outside polybridge's vocabulary. So the flag is directional, not a calibrated dial. Support is
  **per model**:
  `opencode models --verbose` lists each model's accepted `variants`; `muse-spark-1.2/1.3` accept
  `minimal, low, medium, high, xhigh`, `ling-3.0-flash-fin` accepts only `low, medium, high`, and
  `big-pickle`, `mimo-v2.5` and both `nemotron` models declare **no** `variants`, so `--variant` is a
  silent no-op on them. `max` — the value opencode's own `--help` gives as an example — appears in no
  model's variant list.

**vibe (Mistral Vibe CLI 2.25.1)**
- `get_prompt_from_stdin()` (`vibe/cli/cli.py:54-67`) runs unconditionally before mode dispatch and
  calls `sys.stdin.read()` whenever stdin is **not a tty** — a pipe that never closes blocks forever.
  `stdin=DEVNULL` is mandatory, same reason as codex's.
- Programmatic mode is `-p/--prompt TEXT` with `--output streaming` for newline-delimited JSON.
- **The `PROMPT` positional is ignored in programmatic mode.** `cli.py:172` reads
  `args.prompt or stdin_prompt`; the positional serves interactive mode and worktree naming only
  (`entrypoint.py:233`). So there is **no working `--` separator** of the kind codex and opencode
  rely on — the prompt must ride on `--prompt`, and `-p` is `nargs="?", const=""`, so a prompt
  starting with `-` is not taken as its value (it falls through to stdin and dies with
  `Error: No prompt provided for programmatic mode`, exit 1 — loud, not silent, but it rules out the
  space-separated form for such prompts). Hence the single canonical token `--prompt=<text>`, last in
  argv. Measured: a prompt beginning with `--max-turns` reached the model verbatim at exit 0,
  unparsed as a flag.
- `sessionId` is a UUID vibe mints itself, present on **every** stream entry including the first, so
  the id is known from line one — `chooses_session_id=False`.
- **vibe renames its own process — measured 2026-09-26 on 2.25.8.** `vibe/cli/entrypoint.py:385`
  calls `setproctitle(process_name())` (`vibe/cli/_process_title.py`), so `ps -o command=` shows
  `Vibe CLI` and the argv markers recorded at spawn never match from then on. Until the fix this
  read as a false death: a *running* vibe task was listed `failed` by `ctl list`/the Monitor
  sidebar, and `resume` refused it, for as long as it ran. Status and the resume guards
  (`store.record_process_alive`) now use the recorded start time when one is present, so a
  retitled live run reads `running` again. Still open: cross-process cancel/takeover of a running
  vibe task stays refused — `may_signal` still requires the markers and reports `markers_missing`
  — which is a deliberate second factor, not an oversight.
- **No terminal event, no dollar cost, no token counts at all.** `--output streaming` emits only
  `PublicHistoryEntry` objects with `generation_status == COMPLETED`. Classification is
  exit-code-authoritative with the closing assistant message as corroboration — the same shape as
  codex, and codex only. opencode looks similar but is not: its `step_finish(reason="stop")` is a
  real end-of-run signal, so it can complete without an observed exit where codex and vibe cannot.
- **History replay on resume, measured.** A `--resume` run emitted, in order: the prior user message,
  the prior `reasoning`, the prior assistant message, a `checkpoint`, and only then the live turn.
  Replayed entries carry `turnId: null` and `source: "harness"`; the live turn's entries carry a real
  `turnId`, and its user message carries `source: "turn_start"`. Ingest must key off that
  `turn_start`/`turnId` marker, not off "first assistant message seen," or the replayed prefix leaks
  into the summary of a resumed task.
- **Turn-cap breach reads as failure, not a clean stop — unlike claude.** Hitting
  `--max-turns`/`--max-price`/`--max-tokens` raises `ProgrammaticLimitError` → exit 1. Measured with
  `--max-turns 1` on a prompt needing a tool call: exit **1**, stderr
  `<vibe_stop_event>Turn limit of 1 reached</vibe_stop_event>`. **The trap is in the stream, not just
  stderr:** the run also emits a *live-turn* `assistant` message whose text is that same
  `<vibe_stop_event>…</vibe_stop_event>` marker, so a naive ingest reports the marker itself as the
  agent's answer. `supports_turn_cap=True`, with that caveat attached.
- **A denial can end a run that already spoke — and a clean exit after one now reads `completed`
  with a warning.** The refusal above is not only a `publish` concern: at *any* freedom, a dispatch
  whose next command falls outside the user's `[tools.bash]` config is auto-denied and frequently
  stops there. Measured 2026-09-22 on two real dispatches replayed through `ingest`: one narrated
  its next step, had bash denied, **changed zero files**, and exited 0 — at the time reported
  `completed` with that narration as its `summary`, because `saw_final_message` had already latched
  on a message that preceded the refusal. So `ingest` **withdraws** the close when it records a
  denial, exactly as the stop-event branch does — but **without latching**, which is the whole
  distinction: a turn cap is terminal, a refusal is not, so a later assistant message in the same
  turn re-establishes the close. The denial stays on `acc.denials` either way.
  The withdrawal alone then made *every* run that ended on a refusal read `failed` — including a
  real dispatch whose every edit had landed and whose only sin was that its last action was refused
  before a clean exit. That is the opposite overclaim, so the policy changed (decided 2026-09-26 by
  the owner): a turn that ends on a refusal and then exits 0 reports **`completed` with a warning**
  naming the refused command, not `failed` with no summary. Every genuine failure signal still wins
  first — an error, a non-zero or unobserved exit, a turn-cap breach — and a run that recovers
  (answers after the refusal) completes with no warning at all. The accepted trade-off, stated so it
  isn't rediscovered as a bug: this reintroduces the 2026-09-22 false success. A run that narrates a
  step, is refused, changes nothing and exits 0 will read `completed`; the warning is then the only
  signal, and for an editing task the worktree is the check.
  **What this still does not fix**, and the limits are worth stating precisely. The second dispatch
  simply ended mid-work with no denial at all, and nothing in the stream distinguishes that from a
  short legitimate answer — it still reads `completed`. A denial followed by a further assistant
  message also re-establishes `completed`, and that message can itself be progress rather than an
  answer; vibe's stream offers no structural way to tell them apart, so neither can polybridge.
  **For an editing task, then, a vibe `completed` does not establish that the requested changes
  landed — check the resulting worktree and run the tests.** Not stated as "the diff is the only
  reliable signal", which overclaims in the other direction: a diff attributes nothing to a
  particular dispatch, and says nothing at all about a read-only or analysis task.
- **An `effect`'s `tool_result` is now normalized too, not silently dropped.** Every `effect` was
  already turned into a `tool_call`, but vibe carries no separate completion event for one — the
  same `id` is re-emitted as its `state.status` moves from a non-terminal value to a terminal one
  (`completed`/`failed`/`cancelled`, measured against real `~/.polybridge/tasks` logs, e.g. a
  `file_edit failed`). `_normalize_effect` now tracks seen ids in two `stream_state` sets
  (`normalize_seen_effect_calls`, `normalize_seen_effect_results`) so the `tool_call` still fires
  exactly once and a `tool_result` fires exactly once, `ok = (status == "completed")`, output from
  `state.output` else `state.error`. An id already terminal the first time it is seen yields both
  events, call then result, in one pass.
- **`publish` on vibe needs `--agent auto-approve`, and so is no narrower than `unrestricted`.**
  Measured: under `--agent accept-edits`, `git commit -am wip` in a throwaway repo emitted a
  `callback` (`detail.kind: "approval"`, `title: "Allow bash?"`), was auto-denied, produced an
  `effect` with `state.status: "cancelled"`, and **no commit landed** — `accept-edits` auto-approves
  `write_file`/`edit` only, leaving `bash` governed by the user's own `[tools.bash]` allowlist, which
  did not cover `git commit`. `auto-approve` is the only profile that can publish, and it sets
  `bypass_tool_permissions: true`, removing every *other* restriction with it. So on vibe the
  `publish` level is a relabelling of `unrestricted`, and `Enforcement` says exactly that.
- **Effort is unsupported outright, and the reason is config precedence, not the missing flag alone.**
  vibe has no `--model` and no reasoning-effort flag — both are config-only
  (`[[models]].thinking`, vocabulary `off/low/medium/high/max`). Its layer precedence, quoted from
  `default_orchestrator.py:30-33`, is *lowest to highest*: schema defaults, GrowthBook experiments,
  **user TOML, project TOML, `VIBE_*` env vars**, runtime overrides, agent profile overrides, enforced
  admin config. A *trusted* project `.vibe/config.toml` (and polybridge passes `--trust`) outranks the
  user TOML and can repoint `active_model`, so an env override keyed off the user config would apply
  to the **wrong model and silently no-op** — the agent-profile layer (polybridge always passes
  `--agent`) and any org admin layer both outrank an env var too, and neither is inspectable from
  here. That silent-no-op failure mode is exactly what this repo exists to prevent, so `model` and
  `reasoning_effort` are both declared unsupported and raised loudly rather than passed through best-
  effort.

**antigravity (`agy` 1.2.14, measured 2026-10-01; real captures in `tests/fixtures/antigravity_*.jsonl`)**
- **`-p`/`--print` takes the prompt as its value** — unlike claude's boolean `-p`. `agy -p
  --output-format …` exits 2 with `-p took "--output-format" as its prompt`. A positional, with or
  without `--`, is refused outright (exit 2, `unexpected argument … Prompts are read only from
  -p/--print, -i/--prompt-interactive, or stdin`), so there is no separator at all: the prompt rides
  as the single canonical token `--print=<text>`, as on vibe. A prompt of
  `--dangerously-skip-permissions --mode plan. …` was delivered verbatim and the run stayed in
  `request-review`.
- The parser is strict: an unknown or mis-split token exits 2 with `flags provided but not defined`.
- `--output-format stream-json` events: `init` (carries `conversation_id` on line one, plus
  `init.model` — null when no `--model` — and `init.permission_mode`), `step_update` (one per step
  state change: `step_type` `user_input` / `agent_response` (with `text_delta` while `ACTIVE`, and
  `usage` when `DONE`) / `tool` (with `tool_name`, `tool_info.parameters`, then `tool_info.output`
  or `tool_info.error` on the terminal state)), and a terminal `result` with `status`
  (`SUCCESS`/`ERROR`), `response`, `num_turns`, `usage`, optional `error` and `denied_actions`.
  **No dollar cost.** Exit 0 on success, 1 on an `ERROR` result.
- **A tool step's `state` does not show a denial; `result.denied_actions` does.** In plan mode a
  `write_to_file` step read `DONE` though no file was written; only `denied_actions:
  [{"action":"write_file",…}]` said so. A denied command step does read `ERROR` with `permission
  check failed … user denied permission`.
- **A headless denial ends the run as a success.** The first permission prompt it cannot show is
  auto-denied, the agent stops, and the run reports `status: SUCCESS`, often an empty `response`,
  exit 0, with stderr `no output produced — a tool required the "<perm>" permission that headless
  mode cannot prompt for`. Polybridge follows vibe's policy for this: completed, with a warning naming
  what was denied.
- Freedom, measured against a scratch repo with a local bare remote:
  - default (`request-review`) and `--mode plan`: workspace file writes denied; read-only commands
    (`git status`) run without approval; mutating commands (`touch`, `git commit`) denied. Plan mode
    also writes its own plan artifacts under `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/brain/<id>/` — outside the
    repo, and allowed.
  - `--mode accept-edits`: workspace writes auto-approved; a write to a path outside the workspace
    was denied; mutating commands still denied.
  - `--dangerously-skip-permissions`: file write, `git commit`, `git push` to the remote, `curl`
    (HTTP 200) and a write outside the repo all succeeded.
  - All of the above is agy's own permission layer plus the user's `settings.json` allow-rules,
    which can widen it — nothing is OS-enforced.
  - `--sandbox` is OS-level, but only for **commands**, and it is not usable for real work. Commands
    could not write inside the repo, nor read `~/.gitconfig` (so every git command failed) or
    `~/.zshrc`, yet `curl` reached the network and `/tmp` was writable. The file-writing *tool* wrote
    outside the repo under it. Polybridge maps no freedom to it. (Measured from inside Claude Code's
    own sandboxed shell, so the in-repo denial may partly reflect that nesting.)
- `--conversation <id>` resumes the same id (verified). **An unknown id is not refused:** stderr
  `warning: conversation "<id>" not found`, a *new* conversation with a different id, exit 0. So
  `ingest` must not let a resumed run's id silently replace the one asked for.
- No way to choose the id up front (`--conversation <fresh-uuid>` is just the not-found case), so
  `chooses_session_id=False`. `--add-dir <repo>` is accepted and harmless, which puts the repo on
  the command line as the identity marker for a fresh run. agy keeps its argv as its process title.
- `--effort low|medium|high|max`: `xhigh` is refused loudly (exit 1, `invalid --effort "xhigh"`).
  It works only with the default model. A model id that encodes its own level
  (`gemini-3.8-flash-low`) plus `--effort` exits 1 with `conflicts with --effort=high`, and
  `claude-sonnet-4-6` exits 1 with `--effort is not supported for model`. Base family names (`gemini-3.8-flash`,
  `gemini-3.1-pro`) do accept it. On the default model, three paired runs gave `low` 0/70/0
  thinking tokens and `high` 145/134/138: non-overlapping, so the levels change behaviour there.
- An unknown `--model` exits 1 with an `ERROR` result whose `conversation_id` is empty.
- **Live input: `--input-format stream-json`, one line per message:
  `{"event":"user","message":{"content":"<text>"}}`.** A claude-shaped line is refused (`missing the
  "event" field`), and so is a `--print` alongside it (exit 2).
  - The process idles after a `result` until more input or EOF, and EOF after a result exits 0 in
    ~0.2 s.
  - **Each written line is its own turn, even mid-turn** — unlike claude, which folds a mid-turn
    message into the current turn. Lines already written when stdin hits EOF still run, one turn
    each, before exit (measured: two queued lines, EOF at the first result, three results).
  - EOF mid-turn lets that turn finish, and resume takes the same live shape.
  - `result.usage` and `num_turns` are cumulative per process: the second result's usage is roughly
    twice the first's, and a resumed live run reported `num_turns: 3`.

**GitHub Copilot CLI (1.0.89) — not supported yet, because nothing can be measured here.** On this
machine every `copilot -p` run fails with `Access denied by policy settings`, exit 1, and the stream
warns `Third-party MCP servers are disabled by your organization's Copilot policy`, so a polybridge
registered inside it would not load either. Both a backend and a client wait on an account whose
policy allows the CLI.

All five CLIs mishandle an unsupported reasoning effort differently, which is exactly why polybridge
validates against its own closed `EFFORTS` vocabulary before any of them see a value: claude degrades
silently with a stderr warning, opencode ignores it silently with no warning at all, codex alone fails
loudly — as a mid-run API `400` — agy refuses one before any model call (exit 1, `invalid --effort`), and vibe has no flag to mishandle at all: its equivalent
(`[[models]].thinking`) is config-only, several layers removed from anything on the command line, and
an unsupported value there would surface (if it ever did) as a config-resolution problem, not a CLI
error. Because that vocabulary is only four literals (`low`/`medium`/`high`/`xhigh`), none containing
a quote or `=`, TOML-quoting codex's `-c model_reasoning_effort="<v>"` value is a non-issue — no
encoder needed, just the literal interpolated between quotes.

**Registering with them as MCP clients (`mcp add`, measured 2026-08-12; vibe measured 2026-09-10; agy 2026-10-01)**
- All four accept `--` and run headless with stdin closed. `stdin=DEVNULL` still matters:
  `opencode mcp add` is prompt-capable, and so is `vibe mcp add`.
- **Only Claude Code refuses to overwrite.** Re-adding exits **1** with
  `MCP server <name> already exists in user config` and writes nothing, and there is no
  `--force`/`--replace` on `add` or `add-json`. So an update means `remove` first — which is why a
  failed replacement must tell the user to *assume* nothing is registered (a failed `add` is not proof
  it wrote nothing) and print the restoring command.
- `claude mcp remove` also exits **1** for a name that was absent
  (`No MCP server named "<name>" in user scope`). Tolerate that signature and *only* that one:
  reading every exit 1 as "wasn't there" turns a permission error into licence to delete.
- **Match those signatures whole, with the name delimited.** `<name> already exists` also matches
  `MCP server not-polybridge already exists…`, so a *different* server's collision would make us
  delete ours; the leading `mcp server ` and the quotes around the name in the not-found form are what
  make the checks safe.
- `claude mcp get` is not a readback. It prints human prose, not JSON, and **launches the server** to
  health-check it.
- Codex and opencode `mcp add` **overwrite**, and each preserved comments elsewhere in its own config
  (`config.toml`, `opencode.jsonc`). That is a property of the versions measured, not a promise.
- `codex mcp add` refuses an explicit `CODEX_HOME` that does not exist, but **creates** its default
  `~/.codex`. Only a sandboxed test needs to make the directory first.
- Run these from `$HOME`: a project-local `opencode.jsonc` in whatever directory the installer was
  run from would otherwise capture a registration meant to be global.
- **vibe is a fourth, distinct behaviour — it neither overwrites (codex, opencode) nor refuses
  outright (Claude Code). Its collision has _two_ shapes, and only one of them exits 0.** Measured
  against a sandboxed `VIBE_HOME`:
  - `vibe mcp add <new>` → `` Added MCP server `<name>`. ``, exit 0.
  - `vibe mcp add` with a **byte-for-byte identical** entry → `` MCP server `<name>` is already
    configured. ``, **exit 0, nothing written** — an idempotent no-op.
  - `vibe mcp add` with the **same name but different settings** — i.e. what an update actually is —
    → an argparse failure: a `usage:` block plus
    `` vibe mcp: error: MCP server name `<name>` is already configured. ``, **exit 2, nothing
    written**. Note the extra word **name**, which is what keeps the two signatures distinguishable.
  - `vibe mcp remove <existing>` → `` Removed MCP server `<name>`. ``, exit 0.
  - `vibe mcp remove <absent>` → `` MCP server `<name>` is not configured in the user config. ``,
    **exit 0** — unlike `claude mcp remove`, which exits 1 for the same case.
  - remove-then-add **does** update correctly (verified: the stored command changed). There is no
    `--force`/`--replace` on `add`, so that is the only way to replace an existing entry, and both
    collision signatures must route to it.
  - **A cautionary tale about measuring the easy case.** The first measurement here re-added an
    *identical* entry, saw exit 0, and recorded "silently skips at exit 0" as the general rule. The
    conflicting case — the only one an update ever hits — exits 2, so a client that treated any
    non-zero exit as fatal turned every update into a hard failure while leaving the stale entry in
    place. A real `PB_CLI_INTEGRATION=1` run against the binary is what caught it, not the unit
    tests written from the wrong fact. When measuring an idempotent-looking command, vary the
    payload, not just repeat the call.
  - Because every case *except* that conflict exits 0, **the exit code alone cannot tell success
    from a no-op for vibe** — the stdout message is the signal, and the exit code only narrows which
    message to expect. Match it whole, with the name delimited by its backticks, per the narrow
    signature rule above.
  - `vibe mcp add` also **rewrites the whole `config.toml` and destroys hand-written comments in it**
    (measured: a `# hand-written comment` was gone afterwards, and `args` was reformatted) — unlike
    codex's and opencode's own `add`, which preserved comments elsewhere in their configs.
- **agy** (sandboxed with a temp `HOME`; its config is `~/.gemini/config/mcp_config.json`, plain
  JSON `{"mcpServers": {"<name>": {"command", "args"?, "env", "disabled"}}}`):
  - **Flags must come before the name** (its own help says so), so the shared `add_argv` shape does
    not fit.
  - `agy mcp add --env K=V <name> -- <cmd> [args]` → `Added MCP server "<name>" (stdio)`, exit 0.
  - **It overwrites like codex.** Re-adding an identical entry and re-adding with different settings
    both exit 0 with the same message, and the stored entry is replaced.
  - `agy mcp remove <existing>` → `Removed MCP server "<name>"`, exit 0.
  - `agy mcp remove <absent>` → `Error: MCP server "<name>" not found`, **exit 1**, as with claude.
  - `agy mcp list` prints a human table, not JSON, so inspect reads the JSON file instead.

## Invariants — break these and the design stops holding

1. **Only `_monitor` publishes a terminal status and sets `Task.done`**, after process exit *and*
   pipe drain. Cancellation sets `cancel_requested` and lets the monitor decide. The one status it
   must *not* publish is one for a process still alive: on its own `CancelledError` the server is
   being torn down, not the run, so it leaves the task `running` and re-raises — unless a
   cancellation is already in flight, whose intent nothing on disk could reconstruct. See "When the
   client restarts the server".
2. **Bookkeeping must never change an outcome.** A stale attribute in a *log line* once turned a
   successful run into `failed`, because the exception escaped into the monitor's handler. That log
   call is now individually guarded.
3. **Signal `Task.pgid` captured at spawn**, never `os.getpgid` — pids get reused.
4. **Drainers are load-bearing** (an unread pipe blocks the agent), and waiting on them is bounded by
   `DRAIN_GRACE_SECONDS` (a grandchild can hold stdout open forever).
5. **Persist a session id the moment it is disclosed.** Codex only reveals its `thread_id` mid-run;
   waiting until exit means a server that dies first loses any chance of resuming.
6. **Identity markers, not session ids, decide liveness.** On a fresh run codex never receives its id
   on the command line, so `store.process_alive` matches backend-supplied markers instead; status
   and the resume guards go through `store.record_process_alive`, which uses the recorded start
   time when one is present, so a process that renames itself after spawn (vibe) is still
   recognised. (A *resume* is the one exception — the thread id rides as a positional there, see
   `backends/codex.py` — but the marker-matching logic itself does not branch on that; it is
   unaffected.) See `tasks._identity_markers`.
7. **One live run per session**, checked against disk so two server processes cannot both resume it.
8. **`task_id` is validated before becoming a path** — it arrives from a caller.

## When the client restarts the server

The desktop app tears down and respawns the stdio server mid-conversation — `main.log` shows
`[LocalMcpServerManager] Closing <server>` followed by `Connecting` a second later. Nothing here
times a run out, so **every "the run died at ~N minutes" report is really this**, and the giveaway is
two tasks whose `finished_at` match to the second.

The agent survives it (`start_new_session=True`, so it reparents to pid 1 and keeps working), but
nothing reads its stdout any more, so its output is lost from that point on.

Three places conspired to turn that into a permanent lie, and all three now agree on one test —
`store.outcome_unobserved`: *a terminal status with no exit code was never observed.*

- `_monitor`'s `finally` backstop caught its own `CancelledError` and wrote `failed`.
- `store.write` refuses to move a task backwards, so that `failed` could never be corrected.
- `resolve_status` and `live_session_ids` only checked liveness for `status == "running"`, so every
  later server believed the record.

Measured on claude-code-bridge before the fix: two runs recorded `failed`, still alive ten minutes
later with live API connections, invisible to every tool — and because `live_session_ids` had written
them off, the session-busy guard let duplicates start against the same working trees. Do not
"simplify" the `abandoned` flag away.

One precedence rule falls out of this and is easy to get backwards. An unobserved **`failed`** is the
only status the run's own output may overrule, because it is the one the backstop *guesses*. Every
other status records something the bridge *did* — `cancelled` above all — so it stands even with no
exit code. Reversing those two turns a deliberate cancellation into `completed` (caught in review,
reproduced, now pinned by a test). For the same reason `cancel_recovered` waits for the SIGKILL to
land: `resolve_status` rechecks liveness on a `cancelled` record, so returning early would answer a
cancellation with "running".

A second, quieter overclaim lived in the same code path and is now fixed. `resolve_status`
reconstructed a status by calling `classify(state, exit_code if exit_code is not None else 0)` —
**fabricating a clean exit for a process nothing saw exit.** For the backends with no terminal event
of their own (codex, vibe) that turned "the agent said something" into `completed`, on no evidence at
all. `classify` now takes `exit_code: int | None`, and what `None` is worth is each backend's own
business:

- **claude** completes on its `result` event alone — that is a real terminal event — and only an
  *observed* non-zero exit overrules it. Note the trap: passing `None` through without also changing
  claude's `exit_code != 0` to `exit_code is not None and exit_code != 0` would have *regressed*
  claude, turning every recovered success into a failure.
- **opencode** likewise, on `step_finish(reason="stop")`.
- **codex** and **vibe** require an *observed* zero exit; with `None` they report `failed`. Their old
  `exit_code != 0` already rejected `None` by accident of Python comparison — it is now spelled out
  so the behaviour is intentional rather than incidental.

The recovery note had to change with it: "The run reported this result itself" is false for a codex
or vibe record whose `failed` is an inference from *missing* evidence rather than a reported failure.
It is now chosen from the accumulator and the resulting status — never from the backend's name, which
nothing outside `backends/` may branch on. `record.exit_code` was already nullable on disk, so there
is no migration; the intended behavioural change is that old unobserved codex/vibe records carrying a
final message now read `failed` instead of `completed`, which corrects a false claim rather than
losing data.

Everything that asks "has this settled?" must go through `resolve_status`, never read
`record.status` directly. `_poll_recovered` did the latter and so ended a 55s wait after one 5s tick
on a poisoned record — then reported that the full timeout had elapsed. A wait that returns early
while claiming otherwise is worse than one that blocks.

**What this does not fix.** The orphan's output is gone regardless: its pipes died with the server,
so the raw log stops at the teardown and no summary can ever arrive for the rest of that run — the
recovery note says so in as many words. Fixing that properly means durable spooling (spawn stdout
straight into the append-only log and have servers tail the file, rather than owning the pipe), which
would also make an orphan finish normally. Until then, judge a recovered-alive run by what it changed
on disk. Also still open, both pre-existing: `session_has_live_run` → spawn is check-then-act, so two
servers can still race a resume, and *signal authorisation* (cancel/takeover, `may_signal`) is
stricter than status: with a recorded start time it needs that start time to match **and** every
marker to appear, so a retitled vibe process (`markers_missing`) cannot be signalled cross-process;
without one, only the legacy pid + markers match (`legacy_markers_seen`) may signal. Status and the
resume guards use the recorded start time alone and count any non-`dead` verdict as still running.

**A live-input run across a restart.** The server holds the write end of the agent's stdin, so its
death is EOF to the agent — per the plan's measurement on claude 2.1.281, the process holding the pipe
dying mid-turn does not kill claude (own session): the in-flight turn finishes and writes its
`result`, then the agent exits. What is lost: every message queued with `send_message` that the pump
had not yet written (the in-memory queue dies with the server, and nothing is left to read the
on-disk inbox), and any background task still open, which claude kills at EOF (measured) so nobody
ever sees its result. No `.inbox.closed` marker is written on that path, so a later
`send_message`/`polybridge-ctl send` is refused by the owner check instead (the owner is dead), and
the record settles through `resolve_status` like any other recovered run.

**Live input — the rules that keep a message from being lost silently.** The pump (`task.pump`) is a
dedicated task, deliberately not in `task.watchers`, so `_finish_draining` neither waits on nor
cancels it; `_monitor` lets it finish its exit-path close (`_finish_pump`, bounded) before
publishing, so `undelivered` events precede `task_finished`. Every exit from the pump goes through
the one close protocol — flock `<id>.inbox.jsonl`, forward or report every queued message, create
`<id>.inbox.closed`, unlock, close stdin — and every send takes the same lock, so a message is either
accepted before the close (then written or reported `undelivered`) or refused after it. Nothing is
awaited while that lock is held. `send` answers "queued", never "delivered". Three edges, each from
review: the close re-checks its reason under the lock (an idle close whose idleness has passed is
abandoned; an error that arrived meanwhile drops instead of forwarding); the seal falls back to a
seal *line* in the inbox itself when the directory refuses the marker, and a close that can do
neither is retried `CLOSE_RETRY_LIMIT` times, then forced with a notice — a live run that can never
reach EOF would never settle — and a forced close still tries to seal, counts open background work
as abandoned, and leaves `inbox_reconciled` false unless it both read the disk inbox *and* the seal
landed (an unsealed inbox still looks open to other processes, which can append and be told
"queued" after that read), so `_finish_pump` does a final read and reports every unread line
`undelivered` before the run is published; and after exit, a lock that stays busy for `EXIT_CLOSE_GIVE_UP_SECONDS`
gets `_close_unlocked` (seal first, then read), which senders cover by re-checking the seal after
appending. A send is also refused once the run's own process is confirmed dead, whatever its record
still says. A message written after a result persists `input_after_result` on the record, so a
recovered run whose replay shows no later result reads `failed`, not the earlier success.

Two accepted limits, documented rather than fixed. **An owner-local "queued" is in memory only**:
`send_message` on the owning server appends to `task.inbox_queue`, not to disk, so if that server
dies abruptly before the pump writes it, the message is lost with no event at all (the plan accepts
restart loss; the non-owner path, via the on-disk inbox, is always accounted for). **A stalled or
hostile local process holding the inbox `flock` keeps a live idle task from closing stdin** while
it holds the lock — correctness over liveness, since closing without it could accept a message
after the last forward. Nothing blocks the event loop (acquisition is `LOCK_NB` retried on it), so
only that task waits; cancellation still works.

## Takeover, ctl control commands, open-app (A4)

- **Takeover is humans-only and ctl-only.** Never expose it over MCP. `ctl takeover` and
  `takeover-attach` refuse when `PB_TASK_ID` is set at all or a caller is detected: the interactive
  session runs under the user's own permissions, so an agent reaching it escapes its enforcement.
  The gate **fails closed**: it uses `lineage.detect_caller_detail`, which tells "positively no
  caller" from "could not look" (`ps` denied, unreadable ancestry/session, a related task that is
  neither confirmed alive nor dead), and refuses the latter as `caller_undecidable`. Plain
  `detect_caller` reads both as None, which is right for lineage and wrong for a gate.
- **A takeover's `.ready` is terminal for lease purposes.** Its controller (`polybridge-ctl`) exits
  right after writing it, so `control.recover_abandoned` — which reads anything without `.sig`/
  `.failed` as pending — must never be pointed at the takeover family; `begin_takeover` has its own
  recovery.
- **The session is busy from `.req`**, via `store.live_session_ids` (records ∪
  `control.takeover_reservations`), until `.failed`, the 120 s window lapsing with no attach (a
  pending attempt also stays busy while its controller is not provably abandoned — a deliberate,
  test-pinned divergence from the plan, so a slow cascade cannot let a resume in before `.ready`),
  or the attached
  process confirmed `dead`. `undecidable` is busy. Retention keeps a task exactly while it is busy.
- **Lock order is session lock, then `<id>.lock`**, everywhere (`takeover-attach` takes both).
- The interactive commands were checked against each CLI's `--help` only (2026-09-25,
  `tests/test_interactive_resume_real.py`); each backend's `interactive_resume_argv` docstring
  records what was measured. Never run them from a test: they open a TUI, and codex's writes a trust entry to
  `~/.codex/config.toml`.
- **`ctl run`/`resume` fork.** The child redirects stdio before anything else (a reader of the
  parent's stdout must see EOF when the parent exits) and clears the fork-copied
  `identity.own_identity` cache. Test the fork from a fresh interpreter (`tests/ctl_driver.py`), not
  from pytest's own process, which carries threads by then.
- **Opening the Monitor app never changes an outcome**: scheduled synchronously after registration,
  root tasks only, launcher injectable, every exception a notice. **Opt-in** since 2026-09-28
  (`PB_OPEN_MONITOR=1`; unset or anything else means off), because opening on every dispatch kept
  bringing the app forward. `PB_OPEN_MONITOR=0` in conftest stays as a belt-and-braces default.

## The Monitor app is a consumer of three frozen contracts (Stage C)

`macos/PolybridgeMonitor` reads `polybridge-ctl --json` (`CTL_JSON_VERSION`, now 3 — includes pending messages and workflow ownership/status;
v2 added `resume_command`), `polybridge-setup --json` (its own `JSON_VERSION`,
still 1) and `events.jsonl` (`EVENT_LOG_VERSION`, still 1), and acts only through those two
binaries — it never writes a record, phase file or inbox itself. Each of the three is versioned and
gated independently on the Swift side (`MonitorCore/CtlModels.swift`'s `ctlContractVersions: Set<Int>`,
`SetupClient.swift`'s `setupContractVersion`, `Events.swift`'s `eventLogVersion`), so a change to
any one shape is a contract change on both sides: bump that contract's own `v` (the app refuses any
version outside the set it understands, with a message naming the tool and the versions understood,
rather than guessing), and a new event kind means `events.EVENT_KINDS` and
`TaskEvent.Kind` in
`macos/PbCore/MonitorCore/Sources/MonitorCore/Events.swift` together (an unknown kind decodes as
`.unknown` and is ignored, so an old app degrades quietly). The app's tests use fake
`polybridge-ctl`/`polybridge-setup` scripts, never the real binaries. Backend names appear in the
app only for display styling; every fact it shows comes from polybridge. A new ctl command (like
`backends`) is additive under the current `v` — it changes no existing document's shape, so no
bump; the Monitor treats an older ctl's usage error for it as "unsupported".

The app's UI layer follows a coordinator/VM/use-case architecture (a SwiftPM package per module, wired by path,
under `macos/PbFoundation/`, `macos/PbCore/` and `macos/PbFeatures/`, with the root
`macos/PolybridgeMonitor/` holding only the app shell — `App.swift`, `AppDelegate`,
`AppCoordinator`, `AppModulesRegistry`) — see `macos/AGENTS.md` for the architecture rules this
follows and each package's own `AGENTS.md` for what that package specifically owns.

Before finishing any change under `macos/`, run `swiftformat macos && swiftlint lint` (repo-root
`.swiftformat`, `.swiftlint.yml`; MonitorCore's existing source violations live in
`.swiftlint-baseline.json`, never touch `macos/PbCore/MonitorCore/Sources` to satisfy a rule) and
`scripts/check-private-refs.sh`. The guard keeps this open-source tree from naming a private
project; its patterns are assembled from pieces inside the script, so never quote them elsewhere.

**CI.** `.github/workflows/lint.yml` (Linux) runs SwiftFormat `--lint`, SwiftLint and the guard;
`.github/workflows/test.yml` (macOS) runs `swift test` per Monitor package, `macos/build-app.sh`, and
`uv run pytest` with a temporary `HOME`/`CODEX_HOME`. The headless app smoke stays a local gate.

## Enforcement must never overclaim

This is the point of the abstraction, and the easiest thing to get subtly wrong. Every boolean in
`Enforcement` is a strict claim: True only if the named thing genuinely **cannot** happen. A caveat
does not repair a boolean that says something untrue.

Worked example: Claude's deny patterns refuse `git commit` but are evaded by `git -C` and
`bash -c` (measured). So `commit_push_blocked` is **False**, and the weaker truth lives in
`direct_commit_commands_denied: True`. Likewise Codex confines writes by OS but to workspace *plus*
temp dirs, so `writes_confined: True` is paired with `writable_roots` naming them — never
"confined to the repo".

**`freedom` is a requested ordering, not four distinct strengths everywhere.** Backends may collapse
adjacent levels, and two do: on opencode `publish` is byte-identical to `write_in_repo` (nothing was
ever enforced there), and on vibe it is byte-identical to `unrestricted` (only `auto-approve` can
publish). Where two levels produce the same argv, `assert_safe(argv, freedom)` genuinely cannot
refuse a mismatched freedom — there is no difference to detect — so those pairs are listed
explicitly, excluded from the cross-freedom refusal test, and covered by a test asserting they
really are identical. A collapse that is pinned by a test is a documented property; one that is
merely true is a hole waiting to be mistaken for enforcement.

The two fields `publish` added are named for what they assert. `publish_attempts_allowed_by_polybridge`
is deliberately **not** `publishing_permitted`: polybridge can say it removed the barriers under its
own control, and nothing more — credentials, remote permissions, branch protection, hooks, an
unauthenticated `gh`, and the agent's own behaviour all sit outside it. `network_access` is separate
because network is the material difference for pushing, and `not_controlled` (claude, opencode, vibe)
means the environment decides — which is not the same claim as `blocked`.

If you add a backend or a freedom level, re-measure rather than reasoning about it, and record what
you measured under "Verified CLI facts" above. `tests/test_backends.py::test_enforcement_never_overclaims` enforces the shape;
it cannot check whether your claim is true.

## Telling the caller what happened

The caller is usually a model, and it only knows what the tool surface says. State changes it cannot
infer belong **in the payload**: `enforcement` on every task, `recovered: true` plus a `note` on
tasks from an earlier process, `next_step` when a wait returns still-running, `notices` for non-fatal
messages, and errors that say what to do instead of just what failed.

**MCP status responses are shaped in `server.py` (`_status_payload`), never in the snapshot.**
`get_task_status`, `wait_for_task` and `cancel_task` carry `recent_activity` (≤ 5 one-liners from the
normalized event log) instead of the ~10k-token raw `last_output_tail`, which comes back only with
`include_tail=True` — or shortened, on a failed run, where the raw lines are what diagnoses it.
`get_task_events` pages the normalized log on demand. `Task.snapshot()`/`store.snapshot()` keep the
full tail because `polybridge-ctl --json` is a frozen contract (`CTL_JSON_VERSION`); reshape the MCP
layer, not the snapshot.

A dispatch at `publish` or `unrestricted` also checks whether the checkout is on the repository's
default branch, and says so on `bridge_notices` — a channel separate from `Accumulator.notices`
precisely because vibe's `ingest` resets those per turn and would discard a dispatch-level notice on
a resumed run. Three rules keep that honest:

- It is **disclosure, not a guard.** `start_task` returns after the process has spawned, so the
  notice cannot gate anything; it says to cancel the task, never implies the run was held. It also
  says the branch was read once, at spawn — the agent may switch branches later.
- The default branch is only ever what a remote's own locally recorded `HEAD` says. **Never fall
  back to "the branch is named `main` or `master`"** — a feature branch can be called `main` while
  the real default is something else, which is a test. No fetch, no `ls-remote`, no
  `remote set-head`.
- **Not being able to tell is reported too.** For a run authorized to publish, "which branch this
  would land on could not be determined" is material, so silence would be the wrong answer. Every
  failure mode — missing `git`, a timeout, a detached HEAD, several remotes with no `origin` — is
  absorbed into that notice rather than escaping, per the invariant that bookkeeping must never
  change an outcome. The probes run off the event loop, since they are blocking calls inside an
  async `_spawn`.

`wait_for_task`'s default stays under 60s because MCP clients time out requests around there and
report `-32001` while the run continues unharmed.
